## Description
This toast is inspired by [CocosCreator-Toast](https://github.com/jtly1985/CocosCreator-Toast),which is written in js.

Here i have rewrited it in ts,for ts has become more and more used in CocosCreator.

## Usage
Downlod the two ts files into your project,then you can make a toast just by one line code: ``Toast.ShowText("hello,i am jack", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT);``ï¼Œalso you can omit the param of duration.

If you want get more message about it,you can read the source code.
